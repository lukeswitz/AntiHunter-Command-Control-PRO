## Overview

**AntiHunter** is a low-cost, open-source distributed perimeter defense system for wireless network security and operational awareness. It enables comprehensive monitoring and protection of wireless environments, transforming spectrum activity into actionable security intelligence for defensive operations.

Built on the ESP32-S3 platform with mesh networking, AntiHunter creates a scalable sensor network for real-time threat detection, device mapping, and perimeter security. The system combines WiFi/BLE scanning, GPS positioning, environmental sensors, and distributed coordination to provide a digital and physical "tripwire".

## Primary Detection Modes

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3be1602-c651-41d2-9caf-c2e4956d3aff)

### 1. **List Scan Mode**

Maintain a watchlist of target MAC addresses (full 6-byte) or OUI prefixes (first 3-byte vendor IDs). AntiHunter systematically sweeps designated WiFi channels and BLE frequencies, providing immediate alerts and detailed logging when targets are detected.

- **Targeted Monitoring**: Track specific devices by MAC address or vendor OUI prefix
- **Dual Protocol Scanning**: WiFi-only, BLE-only, or combined WiFi+BLE modes
- **Global Allowlist**: User configurable, applies to all scans.
- **Logging**: Records RSSI, channel, GPS coordinates, and device names to SD card
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notifications via web interface, AH command center and mesh network.

### 2. Triangulation/Trilateration (Distributed)

Triangulation coordinates multiple AntiHunter nodes across a mesh network to achieve precise location tracking of target devices. Each node simultaneously scans for the specified target, recording signal strength (RSSI) and GPS coordinates, syncing RTCs for precision. Detection data is aggregated and forwarded over mesh to the AP and command center for more advanced trilateration processing.

**`EXPERIMENTAL T114 SUPPORT:`** small buffer and slow speed causes some latency. Using a Heltec v3 is recommended but not required.

- **Multi-node Coordination**: Distributed scanning across mesh network nodes
- **GPS Integration**: Each node contributes location data for accurate positioning
- **Weighted GPS Trilateration**: - Method: Weighted trilateration + Kalman filtering. Average HDOP, GPS Coordinates, Confidence, Est.Uncertainty (m), Sync Status, GPS Quality. Google Maps link sent over mesh with details

## RF Configuration

AntiHunter provides adjustable RF scan parameters to optimize detection performance for different operational scenarios. Configuration is available through both the web interface and API endpoints.

### Scan Presets

| Preset         | WiFi Channel Time | WiFi Scan Interval | BLE Scan Interval | BLE Scan Duration | Use Case                             |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Relaxed**    | 300ms             | 8000ms             | 4000ms            | 3000ms            | Low power, stealthy operations       |
| **Balanced**   | 160ms             | 6000ms             | 3000ms            | 3000ms            | General use, default configuration   |
| **Aggressive** | 110ms             | 4000ms             | 2000ms            | 2000ms            | Fast detection, high coverage        |
| **Custom**     | User-defined      | User-defined       | User-defined      | User-defined      | Fine-tuned for specific requirements |

### Parameter Definitions

- **WiFi Channel Time**: Duration spent on each WiFi channel (50-300ms)
- **WiFi Scan Interval**: Time between WiFi scan cycles (1000-10000ms)
- **BLE Scan Interval**: Time between BLE scan cycles (1000-10000ms)
- **BLE Scan Duration**: Active BLE scanning duration per cycle (1000-5000ms)
- **WiFi Channels**: Comma-separated list (1,6,11) or range (1..14) of 2.4GHz channels to scan

### Channel Configuration

WiFi channels accept two formats:

- **Range**: `1..14` scans all channels from 1 to 14
- **CSV**: `1,6,11` scans only specified channels

Valid channels: 1-14 (2.4GHz band). Default: 1,6,11 if no channels specified.

### Web Interface Configuration

1. Navigate to the web interface at `http://192.168.4.1`
2. Locate the RF Settings section
3. Select a preset from the dropdown or choose "Custom" for manual tuning
4. For custom configuration:
   - Adjust individual timing parameters
   - Specify WiFi channels using CSV or range notation
5. Click "Save RF Settings" to apply changes

### API Configuration

**Get current RF settings:**

```
GET /rf-config
```

**Update RF settings (preset):**

```
POST /rf-config
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

preset=1
```

**Update RF settings (custom with channels):**

```
POST /rf-config
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

wifiChannelTime=120&wifiScanInterval=5000&bleScanInterval=2500&bleScanDuration=2500&channels=1,6,11
```

### Configuration Persistence

All RF settings are automatically persisted to NVS (non-volatile storage) and restored on reboot. When an SD card is present, settings are also saved to `/config.json` for backup and portability across devices.

### Operational Considerations

- **Lower intervals**: Increase detection speed and coverage but consume more power
- **Higher intervals**: Reduce power consumption and RF noise but may miss brief transmissions
- **Channel time**: Affects WiFi channel hop rate; shorter times provide faster channel coverage
- **BLE duration**: Longer durations improve BLE device discovery but reduce WiFi scan frequency
- **Channel selection**: Limit to specific channels (1,6,11) for focused monitoring or use full range (1..14) for comprehensive coverage

Adjust parameters based on deployment environment, power budget, target detection requirements, and regulatory constraints.

## System Architecture

<img width="1407" height="913" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67348f3d-6613-462c-8e0f-dad419e43f9a" />

### **Distributed Node Network**

AntiHunter operates as a distributed sensor network where each node functions independently while contributing to the overall security picture. Nodes communicate via Meshtastic mesh networking, enabling:

- **Scalable Coverage**: Deploy multiple nodes to cover large areas
- **Redundant Detection**: Multiple nodes improve detection reliability
- **Distributed Processing**: Local decision-making with centralized coordination
- **Resilient Communications**: Mesh networking ensures connectivity in challenging environments

### **Operational Workflow**

1. **Local Detection**: Each node performs independent WiFi/BLE scanning based on configured parameters
2. **Target Identification**: Matches detected devices against configured watchlists
3. **Data Collection**: Records detection metadata (RSSI, GPS, timestamp, etc.)
4. **Mesh Coordination**: Broadcasts alerts and status to other nodes and command center
5. **Central Processing**: Command center aggregates data for advanced analytics and visualization

### **Command Center Integration**

While individual nodes provide standalone capability, the full system power comes from integration with a central command center that:

- Aggregates detection data from all nodes
- Performs advanced trilateration calculations
- Provides real-time mapping and visualization
- Enables coordinated response operations
- Maintains historical threat intelligence
